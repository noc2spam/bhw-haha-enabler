Do you use adblock on BlackhatWorld, and as a result had your "Haha" reaction disabled? I can understand your pain, as I had the same issue. I made a Chrome extension that semi-fixes this issue (There's an additional confirm page).

Download the plugin by typing `git clone https://github.com/noc2spam/bhw-haha-enabler` in your terminal, or by downloading the zip file. Unpack the archive if you downloaded the zip file.

To install the plugin, go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, and drag the downloaded folder into the page.

The fix is not perfect, but better than nothing.
How to use it? Look for the "Fake Haha ðŸ˜‚" button in the posts.
